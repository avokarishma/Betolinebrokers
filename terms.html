                <p>Betline Brokers provides opportunities for affiliates to promote iGaming brands in exchange
                    for commissions. Affiliates must adhere to the marketing guidelines provided and agree not

                    promoting to underage individuals.</p>

                    <li><b>Payment Terms:</b> Affiliates will receive commission payments once the minimum
                        payout threshold is met, depending on the agreed terms. Payments are processed
                        monthly through bank transfers or cryptocurrency, subject to clearance. Any
                        modifications to payment terms will be communicated in advance.</li>
